\title{Classify Pixels by Colony Bounding Box}
\usage{
classify_pixels_by_box(img_df, colony_data_with_bg, background_normalization)
}
\arguments{
\item{img_df}{`data.frame`. Image data frame created by `initialize_image()`,
containing pixel coordinates and RGB color values.}

\item{colony_data_with_bg}{`data.frame`. Colony data that includes background
intensity statistics (bg_mean_intensity, bg_sd_intensity) from
`calculate_average_intensity()`.}

\item{background_normalization}{`numeric(1)`. Value to add to all pixel
intensities for normalization purposes. Calculated by
`edge_intensity_difference()$difference`.}
}
\value{
A `list` containing three elements:
  \itemize{
    \item `classified_data`: Image data frame with added `label` and `colony_id` columns
    \item `colony_summary`: Summary statistics for each colony including pixel counts and percentages
    \item `total_stats`: Overall statistics across all colonies
  }
}
\description{
Classifies pixels within each colony's bounding box as "clearing", "background",
or "halo" based on intensity thresholds derived from each individual box's background statistics.
Uses mean Â± 2 standard deviations as classification thresholds. Requires
colony data with background intensity statistics.
