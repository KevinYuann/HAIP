\title{Calculate Average Pixel Intensity in Bounding Boxes}
\usage{
calculate_average_intensity(img_df, colony_data, prefix = "bg")
}
\arguments{
\item{img_df}{`data.frame`. Image data frame created by `initialize_image()`,
containing pixel coordinates and RGB color values.}

\item{colony_data}{`data.frame`. Colony data with bounding box coordinates
(new_xl, new_xr, new_yt, new_yb) created by `create_grid_boxes()`.}

\item{prefix}{`character(1)`. Prefix to add to the new intensity columns.
Default is "bg" (background).}
}
\value{
A `data.frame` containing the original colony data plus three new
  columns with the specified prefix: mean_intensity, median_intensity, and
  sd_intensity, containing the statistical measures of pixel intensity
  within each bounding box.
}
\description{
For each bounding box defined by coordinates (new_xl, new_xr, new_yt, new_yb),
calculates the mean, median, and standard deviation of pixel intensities within
that area.
}
\details{
Requires `create_grid_boxes()` to be called first to establish
bounding box coordinates.

Outputs a warning message if there are no pixels within the bounding box
created
}
