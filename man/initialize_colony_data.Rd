\title{Initialize Colony Data from .dat File}
\usage{
initialize_colony_data(path_name, image_df)
}
\arguments{
\item{path_name}{`character(1)`. Path to the .dat file to be read and
processed. The file should be tab-separated with optional header lines
starting with "#".}

\item{image_df}{`data.frame`. Image data frame created by `initialize_image()`.
Used to determine the image height for coordinate transformation.}
}
\value{
A `data.frame` containing the colony data with y-coordinates flipped
  to match image orientation (y increases downwards from top-left origin).
}
\description{
Reads a .dat file containing colony data and converts it to a data frame format.
Automatically skips header lines that start with "#" and adjusts y-coordinates
to match image coordinate system (top-left origin, y increasing downwards).
}
